Sure, here's a sample README file to document the automation code for sharing Hashnode blog posts on Twitter. This README explains what the code does and how to set it up.

# Hashnode to Twitter Automation

This automation code allows you to automatically share new blog posts from your Hashnode blog to your Twitter account. When a new blog post is published on Hashnode, this code detects it and posts a tweet on your Twitter feed with the blog post's title and link.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Hashnode to Twitter automation:

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.
- Twitter Developer Account and API Keys. (You can obtain these by creating a Twitter App on the [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps)).
- Basic knowledge of Python and working with APIs.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tweepy requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

### Configuration

1. Open the `hashnode_to_twitter.py` file in your code editor.

2. Replace the placeholders in the code with your Twitter API credentials and the URL of your Hashnode RSS feed.

```python
# Twitter API credentials
consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

# Hashnode blog RSS feed URL
hashnode_rss_url = "https://yourblog.hashnode.dev/rss.xml"
```

3. Implement the `post_not_already_tweeted` and `mark_post_as_tweeted` functions to track tweeted posts. This can be done using a database or a file, depending on your preferences.

### Usage

To run the automation code, execute the `hashnode_to_twitter.py` script:

```bash
python hashnode_to_twitter.py
```

This will start monitoring your Hashnode blog for new posts and automatically share them on your Twitter account.

### Scheduling

To automate this process, you can use a task scheduler or cron job to run the script at regular intervals (e.g., every hour or day). Be sure to specify the path to your Python interpreter and the full path to the `hashnode_to_twitter.py` script in your scheduling configuration.
